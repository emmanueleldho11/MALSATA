## Long description
India’s hunger statistics are among the poorest in the world.India’s hunger statistics are among the poorest in the world. India was ranked 102 out of 117 countries in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2019. As a comparison, India was ranked worse than Pakistan and Bangladesh. The absolute levels of hunger, particularly among children, are even more troubling. More than 19 crore Indians are undernourished (GHI 2019). More than 56 lakh Indian children (0-4 years), that is, 4.9 per cent, are in the “severe wasting” category (UNICEF March 2020 report), which means that these children have extremely low weight-to-height ratio.

Millions of People die because of hunger. Hunger is the worst situation ever we face today. It is a stage of lack of food. In 2015, 30 people died due to a lack of food and water in times of extreme natural events across India. There were no such cases reported between the years 2016 and 2018. In 2012, there were 217 deaths due to this reason, making it the highest fatality number since 2010.

At times when deaths due to hunger are increasing day by day digital technology could help put more food on oru country table. Where people are facing hunger and malnutrition, a basic form of technology — the mobile phone or a computer can be used to generate data that helps relief oru team to make better decisions on where to distribute food aid. Mobile technology also facilitates the delivery of new forms of food assistance. Here we introduce the application MALSATA to solve the problems of hunger, as it aims at delivering food to all people free of cost.

When any one come asking for food through our app MALSATA implemented at every post office (post office employee incharge with handling MALSATA) can order the food according to their needs. This information will direct go to Food Collection Centres like Community Kitchens , Restaurants etc.. who are already registered in this app as per the service traffic. The one who accept the request first get the chance to place the order and when the request is accepted by the collection centre  the address details of both the collection centre and post office goes to the delivery team (Here, the delivery team will be social service groups). The Delivery team of MALSATA collects the food from Community Kitchens/Restaurants and deliver the order to the corresponding post office.

CONCLUSION
Our team AGASTHYAS aim through this project is to ensure that peoples in rural settings have access at all times to safe and nutritious food, sufficient to maintain a healthy and active life.

To respect the right to food and the right to health.

Peoples living in rural dispersed settings cannot obtain enough food, they are likely to become food insecure and malnourished and may adopt unsafe coping mechanisms that endanger their security.
